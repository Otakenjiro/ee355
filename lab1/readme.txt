EE355, Lab 1

Lab summary: 

Problem 1:
Question 1: 
   $ mkdir backup
   $ cp * backup/
Question 2: 
   $ mv ~/*.h ./
   uses the ~ shortcut for 'home directory' 
   and the . shortcut for 'current directory'
Question 3:
   $ rm -r temp
   by default, $rm only removes directories (files) 
   and not folders. '-r' tells the remove command to act recursively, 
   removing all directories inside a given folder that is meant
   to be deleted. 
Question 4:
   $ ps // this lists all programs currently running 
   once the program name and corresponding number is found, run: 
   $ kill // with the number after a space after kill
